# Code Review checklist
* Is there functions that aren't documented?
* Is there functions that should be documented with the time complexity and are not documented? (Only functions that include loops and/or recursion)
* Is the time complexity optimal?
* Is the code readable?
* Is there a reasonable amount of comments?
* Code duplication?
* Designated and sufficient unit tests for the code?
* Is there forbidden imports?
* If we added new functions:
  * Are they documented? 
  * If they include loops/recursion is their time complexity documented?
  * What is their time complexity?
